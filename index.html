										<h2>Words are powerful. Let them do the heavy lifting.</h2>
									</header>
									<p>When you sell online, you aren't only competing with your product. People don't just look at a photo and immediately click buy. They <strong>read</strong>. You are competing with <strong>words</strong>. Think about your last online purchase. You read the descriptions. You scrolled through features. Something in those words made you think 'this company gets me' or 'I actually need this.' That's what good copy does. It connects. It convinces. It sells. And that's what I do.</p>
